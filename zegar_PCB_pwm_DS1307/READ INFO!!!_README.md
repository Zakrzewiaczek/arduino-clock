How to use program?

1. Upload program
2. [If you want the clock to change brightness automatically]
   
   (Every time you turn on the device)
     If it's day: open the blinds, curtains, etc. Make sure the room is not dark (as it should be so that the clock lights up normally)
     If it's night: turn on light.
   
   [If you want to set the clock to change brightness at fixed times]

   

  If the clock does not show the time, try reloading the program.
