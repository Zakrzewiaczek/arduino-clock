Clock using Arduino and DS1307 clock module.

How to make this?
1. Open projects (1. https://easyeda.com/editor#project_id=ebc62a5d52e746e89a3163d7f2d4be14) (2. https://easyeda.com/editor#project_id=743cd00552634c4bb057b5ad1b437f9e)
2. Save gerber files (Fabrication > PCB Fabrication File (Gerber) )
3. Buy PCB (e.g. on JLCPCB or PCBWay)
4. Solder the components onto the PCB
5. Connect all PCBs (diagram in the file diagram.png)
6. Upload code (file 'zegar_PCB_pwm_DS1307.ino' in 'zegar_PCB_pwm_DS1307' folder)
7. Voila! Your clock is finished!

If code or something else is not working, make new Issue. I will correct code ASAP.

Enjoy :)

   the comments are written in Polish [try using Google Translate, it will help you understand ;) ]
